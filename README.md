# Recommendation-Engines
##### Implemented different Recommendation Engine models on Collaborative filtering and Association based algorithms.

<br>1 - Collaborative Filtering based on Nearest Neighbors using Hamming distance.<br />
<br>2 - Collaborative Filtering based on Nearest Neighbors using Pearson's correlation.<br />
<br>3 - Collaborative Filtering based on Latent Factor (It solves sparse matrix problem and is highly efficient too).<br />
<br>4 - Collaborative Filtering based on Regression and uses Gradient descent algorithm to reduce cost.<br />
<br>5 - Association based Recommendation Engine based on Apriori Association.<br />
