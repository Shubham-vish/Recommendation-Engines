# Recommendation-Engines
##### Implemented different Recommendation Engine models on Collaborative filtering and Association based algorithms.

1 - Collaborative Filtering based on Nearest Neighbors using Hamming distance.
2 - Collaborative Filtering based on Nearest Neighbors using Pearson's correlation.
3 - Collaborative Filtering based on Latent Factor (It solves sparse matrix problem and is highly efficient too).
4 - Collaborative Filtering based on Regression and uses Gradient descent algorithm to reduce cost.
5 - Association based Recommendation Engine based on Apriori Association.
